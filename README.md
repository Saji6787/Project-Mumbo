## Project Mumbo

Project Mumbo is a 2D pixel-art survival sandbox game built with Godot, focused on **system-driven gameplay rather than scripted content**.

The player is dropped into a hostile, procedurally generated fantasy world with nothing and must survive through **resource gathering, crafting, combat, and base building**. There are no predefined classes or linear progression — character growth emerges naturally from player actions.

The core design goal of Project Mumbo is to explore **"learning by doing" progression**, lightweight survival mechanics, and emergent gameplay loops inspired by games like Terraria and Don't Starve, while remaining technically feasible for a small-scale development scope.

This repository currently contains an **early-stage prototype**. Many systems are incomplete, unstable, or subject to major refactoring. The current focus is on establishing a solid gameplay foundation before expanding content or complexity.
